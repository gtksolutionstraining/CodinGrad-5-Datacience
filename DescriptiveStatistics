Summarization ==> Measure of central Tendency
    1. Numerical Feature
        MCT -> Mean(Average), Median
        Age: 0-120, 
        Salary: 15K, 500K, 30M

      --> 10,09,08,12,17,07,11,06
      Mean/Average = 10
      --> 06,07,08,09,10,11,12,17
        9+10/2 = 9.5
      Median = 9.5
      Salary --> 0.001K, 15K,20K,18K,30K,32K,23K,25K,27K,150K
      Mean/Average = 37K
      15K,18K,20K,23K,25K,27K,30K,32K,150K
      Median = 25K

*** MEAN as central tendency is too worst summarization when there are outliers
*** MEDIAN as central tendency is too good when there are outliers. Median doesn't take outliers at all in the calculation centeral tendency.
*** GEOMEAN is a good central tendency as it will consider outliers not much as MEAN.
    --> GMEAN ==> You have to drop NULL values, and Zeros
** If GMEAN is between MEAN and MEDIAN then the data is -vely skewed
** If GMEAN is between MEDIAN and MEAN then the data is +vely skewed
    2. Categorical Feature
        MCT -> Mode. => The most frequently occured category in categorical feature.

        Class Students:
            M,F,M,M,M,M,F,F,M,F,F,M,F,F,M
            M = 8
            F = 7
        
        Rating:
            *,**,***,***,***,****,*,**,****

Data Distribution/Visualization:
 1. Normal/Gaussian Distribution
 2. +vely skewed Distribution
 3. -vely skewed Distribution
 4. -vely Kurtosis Distribution
 5. Spiked data/+vely Kurtosis Distribution


==> If the data is in Normal Distribution, Then the data is perfect.


Dispersion: Is a measure of central tendency that, describes how the data is dispersed, distributed.
    1. Variance: The measure of how the data is variated from the central tendency.
    2. Standard Deviation: sqrt variance is Standard deviation
        The measure of how the data is deviated from central tendency.
