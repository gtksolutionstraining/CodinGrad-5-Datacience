Statistics is an in-depth analysis of both data and machine learning
1. Statistical Analysis 
2. Data Analysis

1. Statistical Analysis w.r.t Data 

    1. Data: Improper Information
    2. Curated, Transformed and well versed Data
    3. Types of Data:
        1. Structured Data
        2. Semi Structured Data
        3. Image/Video Data
            1. Signal Processing
            2. Digital Image Processing
        4. Text Data/Unstructured Data

Structured Data:
1. Tabular Data
2. Rows and Columns
3. 2D Array/Matrix
4. Data Frame

Experiment/Observation/Example/Instance/Row/Tuple
Variable/Attribute/Feature/Field/Column

A Random Experiment/Observation is a function of fields/variables/attributes/


Variable/Attribute/Feature/Field/Column:
    Features are segregated into its primitive data types
        1. INT features
        2. FLOAT features
        3. STRING features
        4. BOOLEAN features

    Features are segregated into 2 types based on some properties
        1. Numerical Features
            1. Interval Scale
            2. Ratio Scale
        2. Categorical Features

    ** The outcomes of a feature are bounded then its categorical feature.
    ** All discrete features are categorical features.
    ** All continuous features are need not be numerical features.

1. Account Number:
    -- Not a Numerical Feature/ Categorical Un Important Nominal feature.
2. Age:
    -- Numerical Features.

Statistical Tests:
    Chi-Square Test
    Spearsmen Test
    Pearson Test

All machine learning models need the data in numbers.
-> All Numerical Features are numbers -> INTS, FLOATS
-> Categorical Features need not be numbers 
    --> String --> Numbers
--> Gender -> Nominal Categorical Features
    --> MALE - 1
    --> FEMALE - 2
    --> NOT TO SPECIFY - 0
--> Grade -> Ordinal Categorical Features
    --> S - 0
    --> A+ - 1
    --> A
    --> B+
    --> B
    --> F - 1
--> Rating ->
    --> **
--> Marital Status 
    --> Married
    --> Unmarried
    --> Widow
    --> Divorced
--> Hair Color
    --> Brown
    --> Gray
    --> Black
    --> White
--> Employee ID --> Nominal Categorical Feature.
    --> 001,11120101
    --> 565756

--> Age --> Numerical Feature
    --> 34,68
--> Salary --> 
    --> 
--> IsSmoker -- Binary Categorical Features.
    --> Yes/No

1. Given a feature and its values. We have to do 2 tests
    1. Interval Scaled Test --> If the difference between any values in the feature making sense, then such features are interval scaled numerical features.
    2. Ratio Scaled Test --> If the division between any values in the feature making sence then such features are called ratio scaled numerical features.


Domain Expertise
Continuous function:
f(x)

x is an input --> For every x we have f(x) --> y
