Statistics is an in-depth analysis of both data and machine learning
1. Statistical Analysis 
2. Data Analysis

1. Statistical Analysis w.r.t Data 

    1. Data: Improper Information
    2. Curated, Transformed and well versed Data
    3. Types of Data:
        1. Structured Data
        2. Semi Structured Data
        3. Image/Video Data
            1. Signal Processing
            2. Digital Image Processing
        4. Text Data/Unstructured Data

Structured Data:
1. Tabular Data
2. Rows and Columns
3. 2D Array/Matrix
4. Data Frame

Experiment/Observation/Example/Instance/Row/Tuple
Variable/Attribute/Feature/Field/Column

A Random Experiment/Observation is a function of fields/variables/attributes/


Variable/Attribute/Feature/Field/Column:
    Features are segregated into its primitive data types
        1. INT features
        2. FLOAT features
        3. STRING features
        4. BOOLEAN features

    Features are segregated into 2 types based on some properties
        1. Numerical Features
            1. Interval Scale
            2. Ratio Scale
        2. Categorical Features

    ** All discrete features are categorical features.
    ** All continuous features are need not be numerical features.
Continuous function:
f(x)

x is an input --> For every x we have f(x) --> y
